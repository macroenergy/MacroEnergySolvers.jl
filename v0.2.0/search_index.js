In the future, we hope to support several algorithms that can be applied to solve these large-scale mixed integer linear programs. \n\ntip: Peer-reviewed work\nCurrently, the repository includes the regularized Benders decomposition algorithm described in:F. Pecci and J. D. Jenkins (2025), \"Regularized Benders Decomposition for High Performance Capacity Expansion Models,\" in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2025.3526413.\n\nnote: Future plans\nOther algorithms are possible and could be added in the future (e.g., Nested Benders Decomposition). If you would like to develop a decomposition method for macro-energy system models, please open a pull request or get in touch with us, we welcome any contributions.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Getting Started","title":"Installation","text":"using Pkg\nPkg.add(\"MacroEnergySolvers\")","category":"section"},{"location":"#Usage","page":"Getting Started","title":"Usage","text":"# Import the package\nusing MacroEnergySolvers\n\n# Create configuration\nsetup = Dict(\n    :MaxIter=> 50,\n    :MaxCpuTime => 7200,\n    :ConvTol => 1e-3,\n    :StabParam => 0.0,\n    :StabDynamic => false,\n    :IntegerInvestment => false,\n    :Distributed => false\n)\n\n# Create a decomposed model (see below for details)\n# [... add code here ... ]\n\n# Run the algorithm\nresults = benders(planning_problem, planning_variables, subproblems, linking_variables_sub, setup)\n\nIn the case of Benders decomposition, the user must generate the inputs for function benders(planning_problem,planning_variables,subproblems,linking_variables_sub,setup) where:\n\nplanning_problem is a JuMP model describing a planning problem (without the auxiliary variables that estimate operating costs).
